# Customer Segmentation using K-Means

This project shows how to segment customers using the K-Means clustering algorithm in Python. It walks through the full process—from data exploration to cluster visualization—using a Jupyter Notebook.

  - Loading and exploring the customer dataset
  - Preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, scaling)
  - Picking the optimal number of clusters (Elbow Method, silhouette, etc.)
  - Applying K-Means clustering
  - Visualizing and interpreting cluster results

Customer segmentation gives businesses actionable insight. By grouping customers based on similar traits—like income, age, or spending—the approach helps:

- Tailor marketing strategies
- Focus efforts where they matter most
- Understand customer behavior on a deeper level
